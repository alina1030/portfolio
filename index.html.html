  <p class="human"><b>1. Human Mining Activity Pattern using IoT and Machine Learning</b></p>
   
<p class="para1">Activity pattern of humans are analyzed in a household environment to track the energy consumption level of household devices. Energy level consumed is stored into a cloud service named Adafruit and once the energy consumed crosses a certain threshold limit, using IFTTT web-based service applet, we send an alert message to the user via email notifying him the overconsumption of an appliance.

  <p><b>2. Automatic room light and fan controller with bidirectional visitor counter</b></p>
<p class="para2">
This project is about an automatic room light and fan controller that turns on the light and fan when a person enters the room and turn off the light when a person leaves the room. Components utilized in this project are sensors, motors, arduino uno and a microcontroller. Each time a person enters the room , the counter will count the number of people entering as well as decrement the count when the persons are leaving the room. The number of people who have entered or left the room are displaced using an LCD display.</p>
  
  <p><b>3. Rainfall Water Detector</b></p>
<p class="para3">
This project is a simple and reliable circuit of rain water detector. It is a battery powered device which combines a sensor, a buzzer for alarm system, silicon transistor, resistor and other components. Sensor is made using a piece of aluminum wire with no spaces between the wires. When the rain water sensor is completed, it should get connected to the circuit and voltage should be passed through the wires.

If there is no rain, the resistance between the wires will be very high and there will be no conduction between the wires in the sensor. If there is rain, the water drops will fall on the sensor board which simultaneously decreases the resistance between the wires and the wires on the sensor board will conduct and trigger the buzzer to activate the alarm.</p>
